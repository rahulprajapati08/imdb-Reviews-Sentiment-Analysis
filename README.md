# 🎬 IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis App

This project is an interactive **Sentiment Analysis Web App** built using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** and deployed with **Streamlit**. It analyzes IMDB movie reviews and classifies them as **positive** or **negative** — showcasing both my deep learning and app deployment skills.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

- 🧠 **Model**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Embedding + LSTM layers
- 💬 **Task**: Binary sentiment classification on IMDB movie reviews
- 🌐 **App Framework**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, NLTK, Pandas

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply NLP and deep learning to understand textual sentiment
- Build an end-to-end workflow: preprocessing → model training → app interface
- Make the solution accessible via a simple and intuitive web UI
